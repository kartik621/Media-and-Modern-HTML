    <h1 style="margin: 20px; font-family: roboto;">Web Accessibility</h1>
    <p style="margin: 20px; font-family: roboto;">Web accessibility refers to the inclusive design and development of websites, web applications, and other digital content, ensuring that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web effectively. It aims to remove barriers and provide equal access to information and functionality for all users, regardless of their abilities.</p>
    <p style="margin: 20px; font-family: roboto;">Assistive devices play a crucial role in enhancing web accessibility by providing alternative ways for people with disabilities to interact with digital content. Here are some common assistive devices used for web accessibility:</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-family: roboto;"><b>Screen Magnifiers:</b> Screen magnifiers enlarge portions of the screen, making it easier for users with visual impairments to read and interact with content. They help users with low vision or those who have difficulty reading small text.</li>
        <li style="font-family: roboto;"><b>Braille Displays:</b> Braille displays are tactile devices that convert digital text into braille characters, allowing users who are blind or have low vision to read and navigate web content through touch.</li>
        <li style="font-family: roboto;"><b>Keyboard Alternatives:</b> Some individuals with mobility impairments may not be able to use a standard keyboard effectively. Keyboard alternatives include devices like sip-and-puff switches, head pointers, or eye-tracking systems, which enable users to navigate websites and interact with content using alternative input methods.</li>
        <li style="font-family: roboto;"><b>Voice Recognition Software:</b> Voice recognition software allows users to control and navigate websites using their voice. It can be particularly helpful for individuals with mobility impairments or those who have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse.</li>
        <li style="font-family: roboto;"><b>Screen Readers:</b> Screen readers are software applications that read out the content of web pages and applications to users who are blind or have low vision. They convert text into synthesized speech or braille, enabling users to navigate and consume web content.</li>
        <li style="font-family: roboto;"><b>Captioning and Transcription Tools:</b> Captioning and transcription tools provide text alternatives for audio and video content, making it accessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. These tools display synchronized captions or provide transcripts of spoken content.</li>
        <li style="font-family: roboto;"><b>Assistive Listening Devices:</b> Assistive listening devices, such as hearing aids or cochlear implants, can enhance the ability of individuals with hearing impairments to access audio content on websites.</li>
    </ol>
