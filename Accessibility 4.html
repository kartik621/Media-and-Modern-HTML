    <ol>
        <li style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: white;" ><b>Proper Semantic Structure:</b> Use appropriate HTML tags and elements to structure the content in a meaningful way. This includes using headings (h1-h6) to create a hierarchical structure, using lists for presenting information, and using semantic elements like nav, article, main, etc., to provide clear and descriptive structure to the content. This helps individuals using screen readers or other assistive technologies to navigate and understand the content more easily.</li>
        <br>
        <li style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: white;" ><b>Text Alternatives for Images:</b> Add descriptive alternative text (alt text) to images using the alt attribute. Alt text provides a textual description of the image, which is read out by screen readers or displayed if the image fails to load. It is essential for individuals who are blind or have low vision to understand the context and purpose of the image.</li>
        <br>
        <li style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: white;" ><b>Keyboard Accessibility:</b> Ensure that all interactive elements and functionalities on the website can be accessed and operated using a keyboard alone. This is crucial for individuals with mobility impairments who rely on keyboard navigation. Test the website's functionality using only the Tab key to navigate through links, buttons, form fields, and other interactive elements. Additionally, provide visual focus indicators (e.g., highlighting or outlining) to indicate the currently focused element, making it easier for users to identify their position on the page.</li>
