    <h1>Using Of Semantic Tags</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Improved Accessibility:</b> Semantic tags provide meaningful structure and context to web content, making it easier for screen readers and assistive technologies to understand and navigate the page. This helps individuals with disabilities access and interact with the content effectively.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</b> Search engines rely on the structure and semantics of webpages to understand their content. By using semantic tags, you provide search engines with clear signals about the purpose and hierarchy of different elements on your page. This can enhance your website's visibility and ranking in search engine results.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Enhanced User Experience:</b> Semantic tags contribute to a better user experience by organizing content in a logical and consistent manner. Users can quickly scan and understand the structure of a webpage, making it easier to find the information they need. Additionally, semantic tags can be styled differently by default, making the page more visually appealing and intuitive.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Future-Proofing and Maintainability:</b> Semantic tags are designed to convey the meaning of content, independent of specific styling or design choices. This separation of structure and presentation makes it easier to update or modify the visual aspects of a webpage without affecting its underlying structure. It also ensures that as new technologies and devices emerge, the content remains adaptable and accessible.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Code Readability and Maintainability:</b> Semantic tags improve the readability and maintainability of your HTML code. When using semantic tags, the structure and purpose of different page elements are self-explanatory, making it easier for other developers to understand and work with your codebase.</li>
    </ol>
